# PongGame

This is a project I did back in my last year of High School when I was introduced to GUI in Java, this is a further developed version from my original ball drop game, which was single player. Pong Game is a multiplayer game that utilizes the Java Swing graphics library and the RunMe.bat file to run the game.
